# 1 What is bparser?
It is a library for parsing C99 code (and C11 in the future).

For generating the parser, it uses bison and flex. The corresponding rules
were taken by TODO and have been filled with code.

# 2 Why using bparser?

  * bparser has no library dependencies (bison and flex are used for code
    generating only)
  * bparser is a very fast parser (TODO: benchmarks)
  * bparser is minimal: a very small parser
  * bparser is easy to use and offers plugin features

# 3 Documentation
Type `make doc` for doxygen. TODO: more stuff here...

# 4 Credits
The author thanks:
  * currently no one
